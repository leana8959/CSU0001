# Homework 5

## 5.1 Rotation

Given a 2-d coordinate and θ, please rotate this point with θ counter-clockwise where the circle center is O. In the code, the user input is in degrees instead of radians, therefore I added another variable to turn the user input into raidans (which is the unit `cos()` and `sin()` use in `<math.h>`)

**Please note that the example code is not the actual code that will be run by the TAs to check grades**



## 5.2 Memcmp

Please read the manual of memcmp. This is a C standard function. This time, I want you to develop this function, mymemcmp, yourself. The behavior should be the same with the manual. 

**Please note that the example code is not the actual code that will be run by the TAs to check grades**



## 5.3 Finite State Machine

In this homework, our professor restricted any usage of `if`, `else`, or `switch` statements in the state transitions. So I have resorted to using lookup table and array of function pointers to execute the FSM. Please note that there are still `if/else` statements in the code, but it is in the section of transforming the input into the enum format. The actual state transition, however, does not use any `if/else` or `switch` statement.

## Note

For 5.4 and 5.5 - I was unable to finish it before my homework deadline (I have 6 other final exams and about 5 assignments before the homework deadline)
